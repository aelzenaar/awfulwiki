# awfulwiki

This piece of software is a nasty hacked together semi-clone of [WikiWikiWeb](http://wiki.c2.com).

You need [thttpd](http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd/); then run `./run.sh`, and click on `aw.cgi` in the directory listing.

[markdown2](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2) is also a dependency. Some patches which might make awfulwiki use
easier can be found [in my fork](https://github.com/aelzenaar/python-markdown2).
